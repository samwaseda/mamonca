This is my personal depository, although I think the following codes could be important to many people

# Monte Carlo code (MC)

This code allow the user to launch MC simulations from pyiron or other platforms. Explanations follow...

# Ridge regression code (RIDGE)

To launch an individual coefficient ridge regression, i.e. the regularization parameter is by default defined for each individual coefficient, so that the result a priori should not depend on the number of parameters, in contrast to what normal ridge regression would do.
